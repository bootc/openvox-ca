  # List of PR branches to integrate (Renovate PRs are deliberately excluded).
  # These are origin/ refs so each build integrates what is actually on the PR
  # rather than a stale local copy; the fetch below refreshes them.
  origin/fix/etcd-jitter-nosemgrep  # PR #149
  origin/fix/signer-psk-pipe        # PR #150
  origin/feature/compose-reorg      # PR #145

  # Stack: #154 was cut from #151, but the two have since diverged
  origin/feature/cert-index         # PR #151
  origin/feature/etcd-inventory     # PR #154

  # Stack: #143 and #157 were both cut from #142. #157 still has it as an
  # ancestor; #143 has diverged from it.
